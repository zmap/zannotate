ZAnnotate
=========

ZAnnotate is a Go utility that facilitates annotating large datasets
with network metadata. Right now this includes:

 * Maxmind GeoIP2
 * AS/Routing Data (based on an MRT routing table)

For example, you can add Maxmind geolocation data to a list of IPs:

	cat ips.csv | zannotate --geoip2 --geoip2-database=geoip2.mmdb


# Installation

ZAnnotate can be installed using `make install`

```shell
make install
```

or if you don't have `make` installed, you can use the following command:

```shell
cd cmd/zannotate && go install
```

Either way, this will install the `zannotate` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

Check that it was installed correctly with:

```shell
zannotate --version
```

# Input/Output

## Output
By default, ZAnnotate reads new-line delimited IP addresses from standard input and outputs a JSON object per line to standard output like:

```shell
echo "1.1.1.1" | zannotate --rdns --geoasn --geoasn-database=/path-to-geo-asn.mmdb
```

```json
{"ip":"1.1.1.1","geoasn":{"asn":13335,"org":"CLOUDFLARENET"},"rdns":{"domain_names":["one.one.one.one"]}}
```

If an IP address cannot be annotated, either because of an error or lack of data, there will be an empty field for that annotation.
For example, if an IP address is private and therefore has no RDNS or ASN data, the output will look like:
```shell
echo "127.0.0.1" | zannotate --rdns --geoasn --geoasn-database=/path-to-geo-asn.mmdb
```

```json
{"geoasn":{},"rdns":{},"ip":"127.0.0.1"}
```

## Input
You may wish to annotate data that is already in JSON format. You'll then need to use the `--input-file-type=json` flag.
This will insert a `zannotate` field into the existing JSON object. For example:

```shell
echo '{"ip": "1.1.1.1"}'  | ./zannotate --rdns --geoasn --geoasn-database=/path-to-geo-asn.mmdb --input-file-type=json    
```

```json
{"ip":"1.1.1.1","zannotate":{"geoasn":{"asn":13335,"org":"CLOUDFLARENET"},"rdns":{"domain_names":["one.one.one.one"]}}}
```
